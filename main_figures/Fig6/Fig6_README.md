# Figure 6

This folder contains everything needed to reproduce the code-generated panels in **Figure 6**, including panel-specific data and (when needed) panel-specific external code.

---

## Contents

- `Fig6.py`  
  Entry script to reproduce Figure 6 (generates the figure and/or panel outputs).

- `Panel_A_B_C_data/`  
  Inputs and/or cached intermediates required for **Panel A, B, C**.
---

## Environment

### Default (SimSpace)
Most of Figure 6 should run in the default environment:
```bash
# Run the line below if not creating the repro env before
# conda env create -f ../../environment.yml
conda activate simspace-repro
```

---

## Run Figure 6

From the repository root:
```bash
python main_figures/Fig6/Fig6.py
```

Or from this directory:
```bash
python Fig6.py
```

## Panel A B C data 

### simspace_fitted_params.json
These files are generated by SimSpace fitting process `simspace.spatial_fit()`, with the parameters as `population_size=100 generations=30, shape=(100, 100), n_group=2, n_state=9, replicate=1, seed=0`. They records the reference-based simulation results from simspace reference-based simulations. 

### CODEX_*.csv

CODEX reference data for visualization and simulation. It belongs to an ongoing project which is targeted to be published at summer 2026. In details, it records the coordinates and protein marker expression level of each cell. 

### perturb/ss_perturb_*.json

These files are the perturbed SimSpace parameter files for panel C. In details, for each perturbed json file, the spatial proximity between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are changed.
